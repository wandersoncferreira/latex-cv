\section*{Objectives}
A position as Software Engineer. Despite my academic background, I
always worked with software or algorithm development. Since 2016 I
have been working full-time with software development related to
Machine Learning (MLE) solutions.  Today I have a great interest for
software that add business value. I also have a great experience with
Machine Learning models, techniques and the infrastructure needed to
perform predictive analytics.  Today I am very interested into
Functional Programming and despite my knowledge and desire to work
with MLE in the future, I would love to be focusing on software
itself.
