\section*{Objectives}
Build products that last the test of time.

\section*{Brief Summary}

I have been working with software and/or algorithm development since 2010. I've
been exposed to several industries such as supply chain, financial services,
healthcare, gaming, and cyber security. The main programming stack have been
Python, Golang, Scala, and mostly Clojure.
